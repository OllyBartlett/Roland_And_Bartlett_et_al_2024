# Sustained greening of the Antarctic Peninsula observed from satellites 
Google Earth Engine JS code used in "Sustained greening of the Antarctic Peninsula observed from satellites", [Roland and Bartlett et al., 2024](https://rdcu.be/dV0dc)

Abstract:
The Antarctic Peninsula has experienced considerable anthropogenic warming in recent decades. While cryospheric responses are well defined, the responses of moss-dominated terrestrial ecosystems have not been quantified. Analysis of Landsat archives (1986–2021) using a Google Earth Engine cloud-processing workflow suggest widespread greening across the Antarctic Peninsula. The area of likely vegetation cover increased from 0.863 km2 in 1986 to 11.947 km2 in 2021, with an accelerated rate of change in recent years (2016–2021: 0.424 km2 yr−1) relative to the study period (1986–2021: 0.317 km2 yr−1). This trend echoes a wider pattern of greening in cold-climate ecosystems in response to recent warming, suggesting future widespread changes in the Antarctic Peninsula’s terrestrial ecosystems and their long-term functioning.

# Code used to generate study results, GAP_Legacy_C1
The study was conducted from 2019 to 2022 before the availability of LANDSAT Collection 2. The code presented here reflects the code used to generate the results presented in the paper. This code will not work in GEE as collection 1 is now a legacy asset and removed from the platform. 

# Current working code to replicate the study, GAP_Code_C2_TOA
This code can be used in GEE to replicate the study and generate results in line with those presented by the paper. Due to changes applied to imagery in the compilation of LANDSAT collection 2, this code cannot gaurantee exact reproduction of identical results to the paper, though the overall trends observed are highly comparable.
