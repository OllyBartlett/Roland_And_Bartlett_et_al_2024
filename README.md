# Satellites evidence sustained greening of the Antarctic Peninsula
Google Earth Engine JS code used in "Satellites evidence sustained greening of the Antarctic Peninsula",  Roland and Bartlett et al., 2024.. 

# Code used to generate study results, GAP_Legacy_C1
The study was conducted from 2019 to 2022 before the availability of LANDSAT Collection 2. The code presented here reflects the code used to generate the results presented in the paper. This code will not work in GEE as collection 1 is now a legacy asset and removed from the platform. 

# Current working code to replicate the study, GAP_Code_C2_TOA
This code can be used in GEE to replicate the study and generate results in line with those presented by the paper. Due to changes applied to imagery in the compilation of LANDSAT collection 2, this code cannot gaurantee exact reproduction of identical results to the paper, though the overall trends observed are highly comparable.
